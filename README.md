## History
MusiC began as a music classification library but it has grown much more ambitious :)

## What it is now ?
So far it is an extensible extractor. Available source code compiles (and seg faults **shouldn't** occur) but it isn't fully functional yet (give a look below). This project is under development but it is not mature enough to produce a release yet.

## What we have ?
Please, refer to the wiki for more information about Development Status, Building and Dependencies.

## What it will be ?
An extensible data classification library which allows users to create their own features, windows, classifiers, file handlers or configuration modules.

It is developed and tested under Windows XP(32-bits), Linux(32/64-bits), Mac(Intel). Also it is known to be run by Microsoft .Net and Mono Project. .Net 3.5 equivalent or higher is required.

## Next Release
It will happen when all non-future tags(Development Status) turns into OK tags. It will be the first release of this project.
